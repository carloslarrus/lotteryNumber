# This is a react game, where I have use useState and useEffect, to create a lottery number, which contains two different kinds of number. 5 divs with a random  positive number until 99 and 1 div with a positive number until 9

# I use the React library for the layout.

# Clicking on buy, it is possible to "buy" a number, after that clicking on "winning" would checkout if the user won or lost and sending a message according to the result. Moreover, I added a extra functionality to the winning number so if the user click on it, without "buying" a number it will appears a message. By clicking on reset it is possible to start again the whole process.
